# DAP2R-pset0
This is a template for a problem set in PPHA 30536, Data and Programming in R 2. You can use this to practice copying a template repo and submitting through Gradescope and Github. Current version: winter 2024.

We require you to submit problem set assignments to Gradescope through GitHub. To do so, we outlined the few steps you will need to do below. Since you have an unlimited number of attempts, please make a test submission way ahead of the deadline of the first assignment.

**1.**	_Link your GitHub account to Gradescope_: In order to use GitHub to submit your assignments, you first need to link your GitHub account on Gradescope. To do so, on the Gradescope homepage (i.e. where you can see all of your current and past courses), select “Account” > “Edit Account” > “Link a GitHub Account” and follow the instructions there. Note that you do not need to do this step if under “Linked Accounts” you already see the GitHub account you are using for this class. Thus, you only need to do this action once at the beginning of the term.

**2.**	**(You are here!)** _Fork template repo_:  When a problem set is released, there will be a link posted under the “Modules” section of the Canvas website. This link will only be active before the problem set deadline. 

**3.**	_Push your changes to GitHub_: While completing the assignment, using GitHub desktop, push your changes to your GitHub repository regularly. Before making a submission, it is encouraged to double-check that the latest version of your code is displayed in your repository by looking it up on a browser.

**4.**	_Submit your assignment on Gradescope_: On Gradescope, select the relevant assignment, which you can access via the “Gradescope” or “Assignment” tab on Canvas. Then select “Upload Submission”, which will open a small window in which you should select “GitHub”. When prompted for the repository, select the one containing your assignment. For the branch, you should select “main”.

**5.**	_Check your submission_: Once you have successfully submitted your assignment, you will have a “Results” page, which does not contain any information as we do not use an autograder, and a “Code” page. Please double-check the latter to make sure you have submitted the latest version of your code. If that is not the case, you likely didn’t push your latest code to your GitHub repository. If you wish to make changes to your assignment, simply go ahead and then repeat steps 2, 3, and 4 as you have an unlimited number of attempts. Note that we will only grade the latest submission.
